# iOS Course â€“ Apps


## Unit 0x01

> The aim of unit 0x01 is to get a feel for the structure and main components of an iOS app, Xcode as an IDE and how they work together. 

Just start with the apps in 'Basics' and compare the different ways of implementing a grid layout.


### Connect to your Device

We will add a todo list for this. If you want to try this yourself, remember to add a `Provisioning Profile` and `Team` to your target project settings.  Use 'Automatically manage signing'.'

## Tasks


### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Cove of Shadows' (Swift)

- Check which SWIFT concepts you do not yet understand.
- Ask or try them out.

---


### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'The Burning Mountain' (Project)

- Create your first own project via 'File -> New -> Project', then select 'iOS -> App' and a fancy product name - ViolÃ !
- Run your app on various iOS simulators, e.g. an iPhone _and_ iPad.
- Create another iOS App by adding a 'target' (select the main project and then add one in 'TARGETS').
- Rename a project. You will need to rename the project in the 'Project Navigator', the target list and the schemes.

> Do not try to create a project or a target in `ios_course`, as this will make it more difficult to update due to possible merge requests.

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Town of Illusions' (App-Template)


- Try to build an app similar to `BlueprintApp`, i.e. a landing screen and some content, selectable by a `TabView`, holding data in some model.
- You could copy content from `BlueprintApp', but only step by step, so you can see the effects.

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Island of Smoke' (Calculator)

- Create a new app (a copy of) `CalculatorApp` in your project and implement a calculation to the `buttonTapped` function.
- Hint: `CalculatorScreenHint' contains a reference implementation.

---


### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Island of Smoke' (Connect Four)

- Create a new app (a copy of) `ConnectFourApp` to your project and add your own turn management and winner detection algorithm to the `dropDisc` function.
- Hint: `ConnectFourScreenHint' contains a reference implementation.

---


### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'The Inferno Forest' (Sliding Puzzle)

- Create a new app `SlidingPuzzleApp` to your project and implement a 'Sliding Puzzle', see [Sliding Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle)
- Use the layout and data model from `MemoryApp` as a start, if you like.
