# iOS Course â€“ Apps


## Unit 0x01

> The aim of unit 0x01 is to get a feel for the structure and main components of an iOS app, Xcode as an IDE and how they work together. 

---


### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Cove of Shadows'

- Check which SWIFT concepts you do not yet understand.
- Ask or try them out.

---


### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'The Burning Mountain'

- Create your first own project via 'File -> New -> Project', then select 'iOS -> App' and a fancy product name - ViolÃ !
- Run your app on various iOS simulators, e.g. a new iPhone _and_ iPad.
- Create another iOS App by adding a 'target' (select the main project and then add one in 'TARGETS').
- Rename a project. You will need to rename the project in the 'Project Navigator', the target list and the schemes.

> Do not try to create a project or a target in `ios_course`, as this will make it more difficult to update due to possible merge requests.

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'The Inferno Forest'

- Build some easy layout. TBD

---


### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Town of Illusions'


- Try to build an app similar to `caa_blueprint_app`, i.e. a landing screen and some content, selectable by a `TabView`, holding data in some model.
- You could copy content from `caa_blueprint_app', but only step by step, so you can see the effects.

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Island of Smoke'

- Copy the `cbd_connect_four_app' to your project and add your own turn management and winner detection algorithm to the `dropDisc` function.
