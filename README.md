# iOS Course

> Welcome ðŸ˜€

We have three sections 
- a motivation for the language features we need (a_motivation) 
- a Swift crash course, discussing the features from earlier (b_swift) 
- a set of apps as examples to demonstrate some iOS features or frameworks such as views and layouts, models and view modesl, graphics, sensors, etc. (c_apps) 

Just start with the motivation, study the programming language and pick apps of your interest.

See the READMEs for more details.

Have fun ðŸŽ‚
