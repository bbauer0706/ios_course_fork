# iOS Course

> Welcome ðŸ˜€

We have three sections 
- a motivation for the Swift language features we need (Motivation) 
- a Swift crash course, discussing the features from earlier (Swift) 
- a set of apps organised into units as examples or starter applications to demonstrate some of the features or frameworks of iOS, such as views and layouts, models and view modes, graphics, sensors, etc (Apps).

Just start with the motivation, study the programming language and pick apps of your interest.

See the READMEs for more details.

Have fun ðŸŽ‚
