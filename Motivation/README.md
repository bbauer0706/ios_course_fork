# iOS Course

## Motivation

> Finally, we want to build iOS apps for which we need swift. The language is very comprehensive and we want to focus on what we need for the apps first. So we'll start with a brief overview of a few small apps, and collect the features of the language. We will then look at them one by one in the swift crash course.


## Topics found

We must at least discuss these subjects:
- comments
- var, let
- primitive types
- value and reference types
- collections, such as Array
- iterations
- functions and parameters
- functions as first-class citizens, closure variables or properties
- struct, class
- propeties, wrapper, getter, setter, backing fields, $-syntax
- lazy
- private, public
- member functions
- inheritance, protocol
- static
- enums
- trailing closure/lambda
- chaining
- guard
- ?-optionals, Nil-coalescing operator
